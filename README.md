# PADYAK

## Introduction	
Padyak is a biking application available in Android/iOS devices that is created for Filipino bikers. As an application designed for biking, Padyak is primarily centered around finding biking routes within the country. Specifically, the app asks the user to input an origin point as well as a destination in order to map out a biking route for the user to follow. Additionally, the app also shows the user an estimated travel time and the distance needed to arrive at a destination.
Padyak may also function as a fitness app since it shows the amount of calories burned should the user travel towards the designated route given by the app. Furthermore, Padyak also has a feature in which it allows the user to see the weather forecast with a three-hour interval from the current day up to the next five days. Both additional features may provide benefits to the user for their biking. For instance, the weather forecast allows a user to plan ahead of time whether they want to bike and stroll around.
In all, Padyak is an application designed for improving the experience of Filipino bikers. It allows its users to check their current location, find biking routes, track the amount of calories burned, and check the weather forecast. All of which allows the user to plan their biking.

## Scopes and Limitations
Although Padyak is a versatile biking application, it has several limitations. The following are the limitations of the Padyak app:
Availability. Padyak is only available in the Philippines. The routes are centered based in the Philippines and don't have support for international locations;
No Auto-Complete Function. Padyak does not have an autocomplete function for inputting locations;
No Database. Since Padyak does not have a database, it cannot store routes a user may have interest in and;
No User Accounts. Padyak does not have a form of user differentiation and cannot store user account information.

## Target Audience
The target audience of Padyak are Filipino bikers that wish to have a decent time traversing the Philippines and have all the necessary information. However, our application is limited only within the Philippines due to geographical restriction because of the restraint applied by the free use of application program interfaces such as Tomtom, Google Maps, and OpenWeather.
